                                To make changes to the website, you'll need to get a code editor (unless you feel more comfortable using notepad of course).
                                Visual Studio Code is a great code editor that provides a lot of features and has a vast library of free extensions.
                                <br>
                                <a href="tools/vscode/" class="btn btn-blue">Get started with VS Code</a>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Now that you can edit the site, you still need to get your hands on its code.
                                Cloning/pulling (downloading) and pushing (uploading) changes to GitHub can be done using the version control system called Git.
                                VS Code provides a great interface to Git, but you are free to use any Git client you like. Personally, I like to use <a href="https://git-fork.com/">fork</a>.

                            <p>
                                Everytime you load a website, your browser has to somehow get the sites data from the server where it's stored.
                                To learn how our url connects to GitHub, click the button below.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                To be honest, you will probably almost never need this information, but if the site is down and you can't figure out why, it might help to look over this again.
                                This page contains some tips to debug an outage and explains how to access this documentation when the site is down.

                            <p>
                                Since GitHub Pages only allows the hosting of static sites, the structure of a link is tied to the file structure of our codebase.
                                To see how this affects how we structure our files/pages, click the button below.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It is highly recommended to stick to these guidelines to keep our codebase clean and maintainable.

                                This site, like most websites you see online, is based on 3 languages: HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
                                <br>
                                <b>Html</b> describes the layout of the site, like an advanced word document.
                                <br>
                                <b>CSS</b> will apply styling to all elements in a page, like coloring buttons, or setting the font of the text.
                                <br>
                                <b>JavaScript</b> does everything else.
                                It is the only real programming language in this trinity and is responsible for everything the previous two can't do, like dynamically changing content, or reacting to user input (e.g. for games).

                            <h1>Templates</h1>

                            <p>
                                When writing a html page from scratch, there is often a lot of boilerplate code that is repeated across almost every page (e.g. setting the page icon to the BEST logo).
                                To avoid having all of this code repetition, a template system was created using JavaScript.
                                It condenses all of the boilerplate down into a minimal amount of code required to boot up the system.
                                <br>
                                <a href="code/workings/" class="btn btn-blue">How the template-system works</a>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Another advantage of templates is that they allow for the automatic generation of new elements.
                                This is for example how the navigation works: instead of copying the entire navbar into every page, it was made into a template that could be included in one line.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Along with the template system, we also made a few CSS templates to quickly make buttons, slides, ...
                                The button below links to a summary of all of these templates. They make creating a new page a lot easier, so maybe read through them at least once.

                                I'm very curious what a non-BEST member could be doing on this page, so I'll make you aware of the <a href="/#contact">main contact page</a>.
                                If your issue is website related, you can contact the people mentioned above.
