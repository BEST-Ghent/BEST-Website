                    <h1>A note on <b>authentication</b></h1>
                    <p>
                        Git does not use "accounts" or "users".
                        The only time any credentials are involved is when you try to push your changes to an <b>external server</b>, like GitHub.
                        This means that when you push to GitHub for the first time, you will be asked to authenticate.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The confusing thing is <b>how</b> you're asked to authenticate.
                        You will be presented with a prompt for username and password, and surprise: Filling in your GitHub username and password will not work.
                        This is because what GitHub actually wants is your username and a <b>token</b>.
                        These tokens usually have expiry dates as well. All in the name of security.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You can create a token for your account on GitHub's website.
                        If you don't want to have to log in again every few months you might want to set the expiry date to never, even though GitHub does not recommend this.

                    <h1>Basic Git <b>operations</b></h1>
                    <p>
                        There are a lot of things you can do using Git.
                        While VS Code provides a nice interface to perform these operations, Git also has a CLI or Command Line Interface.
                        A third party Git client like <a href="https://git-fork.com/">fork</a> will of course also expose all these options.
                    </p>


                    <h2>Cloning</h2>
                    <pre><code>
git clone [url_to_repository] [directory]
git clone https://github.com/BEST-Ghent/BEST-Website.git BEST-Website-folder
                    </code></pre>
                    <p>
                        The clone command allows you to clone a remote repository (like the one containing our website) onto your computer.
                        This includes the entire commit history and all branches.
                        <br>
                        You can also specify a directory to clone the files into.
                        If you have already made a folder for this, you can leave this field empty and the repository will be cloned into your current working directory.
                    </p>


                    <h2>Diff and Status</h2>
                    <pre><code>
git diff
git status
                    </code></pre>
                    <p>
                        <code>git diff</code> shows the changes between your code/files and the last active commit <b>that are not staged</b>.
                        <br>
                        <code>git status</code> displays changes <b>that are staged</b>.
                        <br>
                        An example: When you have freshly cloned the website's repository, it's last commit will be the one used to display the public site.
                        By default, this is the active commit.
                        If you make changes to the files in your local folder, they will be displayed when using <code>git diff</code>.
                        You can prepare these changes to be committed by staging them (more on staging next).
                        When changes are staged, they will show up when when using <code>git status</code>.
                        When you later commit these changes, they will disapear from the status, as they won't differ anymore from the (new) active commit.
                    </p>
                    

                    <h2>Staging</h2>
                    <pre><code>
git add [file]
git add training/32-jan-2025/index.html
git reset [file]
git reset training/32-jan-2025/index.html
                    </code></pre>
                    <p>
                        To stage a newly created file or changes to a file, use <code>git add</code>.
                        To unstage them, use <code>git reset</code>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now why stage anything? Well, staged changes can be solidified by committing them.
                    </p>


                    <h2>Commits</h2>
                    <pre><code>
git commit -m “[descriptive message]”
git commit -m “Added a page for the next training.”
                    </code></pre>
                    <p>
                        When you commit your changes, you create a snapshot of your code/files at a certain point in time.
                        This snapshot is not a direct copy of your entire project, but rather a list of all the changes since the previous commit.
                        In the example code above, there is also the option to give the commit a name/title.
                        Many Git clients allow you to specify a title <b>and</b> a description.
                        Whilst this can also be done using the CLI, the command becomes longer and more complicated.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It is important to note that <code>git commit</code> will only commit staged changes.
                        If you forget to stage your changes, you will create an empty commit, so make sure to check that all your changes are staged by using <code>git status</code>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Please give <b>every</b> commit you make a descriptive title.
                        "Update index.html" for example, is not descriptive.
                        "Update Deloitte description" is better and "Updated Deloitte description" is great :-)
                        Good descriptions make it easier to track 
                        There is now still one final step before your changes reach the website: Pushing them to GitHub.
                    </p>


                    <h2>Pushing</h2>
                    <pre><code>
git push [alias] [branch]
git push origin master
                    </code></pre>
                    <p>
                        Changes, commits, branches,... are all part of a repository.
                        But the repository on our computer is cloned (a copy) of the repository on GitHub.
                        This means that when we commit something on our computer, we do it to our <b>local</b> repository.
                        To push these changes to the repository on GitHub, we can use <code>git push</code>.
                        A repository can link to other remote repositories via aliases.
                        When a repository is cloned, a default alias called origin is created, linking to the original repository.
                        When a branch is specified, only the changes to that branch will be pushed to the remote.
                        It is common practice to <b>always specify</b> the branch to use when pushing, because when none is specified, it will try to push all branches, which is usually not intended.
                        The master branch is the main branch where most of the development takes place.
                        If you're new to all of this, creating new branches will probably not be nescessary for you.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Important</b>: <code>git push</code> will ask for some authentication (as mentioned above).
                        But on top of that, it will only work if your GitHub account has the nescessary permissions on GitHub.
                        This is to prevent random people from pushing changes to the site.
                        So make sure to ask someone to add your account to the repository on GitHub.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A note about the name master:
                        At some point, the default branch name for new repositories on GitHub was changed from "master" to "main" because master was too kinky.
                        The repository of our page was made before that change, hence the name of our master branch.
                        Branches can be renamed, but there is not really a reason to do so.
                        If someday, someone does take offense to the name master, they can change the name to whatever they think is better.
                        My personal favourite main branch name is "home" by the way.
                    </p>

                    <h1>How to get the <b>code</b> of the <b>website</b></h1>
                    <p>
                        Using the commands mentioned above, you could in theory figure out how to clone the site's repository to your computer.
                        But if you just want to get started, you can follow this tutorial:
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                Open the command prompt. You can search for cmd on Windows and for Terminal on mac and Linux.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Set your working directory to the folder where you want to clone the code into.
                                You can check your current working directory by typing <code>cd</code> on Windows or <code>pwd</code> on Unix based systems.
                                You can google how to change your current working directory.
                                Usually opening the command prompt will copy the directory you're currently in.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                To clone the sites code, use the following command: <code class="templates-copy-content-on-click">git clone https://github.com/BEST-Ghent/BEST-Website.git</code>.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Once the repository is cloned, you can open the folder in VS Code and start making changes.
                                You can commit and push them using VS Code's built-in Git support.
                            </li>
                        </ol>
