                    <p>
                        GitHub Pages is a service provided by GitHub that hosts any static content in a repository as a website.
                        This is how we can just create a new .html file and have it turn into a page on the website.
                        More on static sites on our <a href="structure">structure</a> page.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You can find the GitHub Pages settings under Settings > Pages. The settings should be as follows:
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                <b>Source: Deploy from a branch</b>. This means the site will come directly from a branch, without any extra processing.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <b>Branch: master, Source: / (root)</b>. We deploy our site from the master branch and from the root folder.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <b>Custom domain: www.bestghent.eu</b>. It is important to add the www prefix, otherwise GitHub gets confused. <a>bestghent.eu</a> gets redirected to <a>www.bestghent.eu</a> via Namecheap.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <b>Enforce HTTPS</b>. This will make sure all traffic to our site is encrypted and safe.
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                        Last but not least: In the repository itself, in the root folder, there needs the be a file called CNAME (without a file extension) containing the text <code>www.bestghent.eu</code>.
                        This links to the CNAME Record in the list of host records at Namecheap.

                    <h1>Namecheap</h1>
                    <p>
                        As the name implies, Namecheap provides domain names for economic prices.
                        Our domain, <a href="https://www.bestghent.eu/" target="_blank">bestghent.eu</a>, is registered using their cheapest, simplest plan.
                        We don't pay for hosting, as we're hosted via GitHub Pages and we don't pay for an email service.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        All we ask Namecheap to do is redirect all requests to <a href="https://www.bestghent.eu/" target="_blank">bestghent.eu</a> to our GitHub Pages setup.
                        This is done by having the following host records under the Advanced DNS section on the dashboard:
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                <b>A Record @ 185.199.108.153</b>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <b>A Record @ 185.199.109.153</b>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <b>A Record @ 185.199.110.153</b>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <b>A Record @ 185.199.111.153</b>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <b>CNAME Record www best-ghent.github.io.</b>
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                        The A Records point our domain name to GitHub's servers.
                        Those will redirect <a>bestghent.eu</a> to <a>www.bestghent.eu</a> and act as the servers serving the sites content.
                        The CNAME Record points all www requests to our organisation's account on GitHub.
                        This allows GitHub to know it is our side they need to serve to the client and not someone else's.

                        In case the site is down, as long as GitHub itself is still up, this documentation can still be accessed by everyone.
                        Simply <a href="tools/git">clone the repository</a>, and access the docs using the <a href="tools/vscode">Live Server extension in VS Code</a>.

                        Now, how to debug: There is of course no complete tutorial on how to debug something like this, but there are places you can start to look.
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                <b>A single page is down</b>: This likely means there is only a problem with the file containing that page.
                                Make sure the file is named <code>index.html</code> and is located in the correct folder.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <b>A page gives a completely blank screen</b>. This sounds like a problem with the FOUC-barrier.
                                You can check for error messages by using Chrome DevTools (can be opened by pressing ctrl+shift+c).
                                Make sure you included the nescessary boilerplate correctly. A guide on this can be found <a href="code/make-a-page">here</a>.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <b>GitHub</b>: as we are hosted using their services, it makes sense to check if everything on their side is set up correctly.
                                Maybe there is a general outage, maybe some settings were changed,...
                                Make sure to check any emails from GitHub regarding changes to GitHub Pages.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <b>Namecheap</b>: same deal with them.
                                Make sure everything is set up correctly as described above, check for emails, ...
                                If you're lucky, we just forgot to pay them and we can get the site back by renewing our subscription.
                            </li>
                        </ol>
