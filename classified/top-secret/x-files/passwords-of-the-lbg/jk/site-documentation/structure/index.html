                        <p>
                            Because we are hosted using GitHub Pages, we can only serve static content on our website.
                            This effects how we structure the pages on our site and hence how we structure the files and folders in the codebase.

                    <h1><b>Static</b> sites</h1>
                    <p>
                        As we are hosted using GitHub pages, we can only serve static content on our site.
                        This means there is a direct correspondence between how files and folders are structured and the links to the pages on the website.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If we create a file <code>index.html</code> in a folder <code>hello</code>, we can find the corresponding page using the link <a>bestghent.eu/hello/</a>.
                        We could also create two pages in the same folder, like <code>hello1.html</code> and <code>hello2.html</code>, but then we get the less aesthetically pleasing <a>bestghent.eu/hello/hello1.html</a> and <a>bestghent.eu/hello/hello2.html</a>.
                        This makes <code>index.html</code> special, as it is the default page to be loaded when no file is specified in the url.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On this website, we <b>only</b> use <code>index.html</code> files to keep our links nice and tidy.
                        This means we create seperate folders for every page we create.
                        The only exception to this is the <code>404.html</code> page in the root folder that is displayed when someone tries to access a page that doesn't exist.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The folders of pages with related content can share a parent folder.
                        The <code>tools/git/</code> and <code>tools/vscode/</code> pages in this documentation are an example of this.
                    </p>

                    <h1>The <b>static</b> folder</h1>
                    <p>
                        Websites require a lot of images to display properly. Most of them also need JavaScript and Stylesheets and maybe even some pdf or mp3 files.
                        All these files have to be <b>stored</b> in the repository to be accessible to the client, but where?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One approach for storing these assets could be the following:
                        If you have a page like <code>training/index.html</code>, you could store your assets in that folder: <code>training/img1.png</code>.
                        This works well for images that are only used once on the entire site.
                        Now imagine we have a profile picture of a board member <code>boardie.png</code>:
                        This image could be used in the about page, in a members page, maybe on the page of an event they are hosting, ...
                        This approach would mean <b>copying</b> the same image multiple times.
                        It also means you can't easily categorize images by type (like pfp's) and easily find the one you're looking for.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This is why we went with a centralized approach: The <b>static</b> folder.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Every</b> file that is not a page (i.e. an <code>index.html</code> file) is stored in the <code>static/</code> folder.
                        There are only 3 exceptions to this rule: The <code>CNAME</code> file, the <code>404.html</code> page and the <code>README.md</code>.
                        The CNAME file links the repository to our domainname (<a href="https://www.bestghent.eu">bestghent.eu</a>) and has to be in the root folder to serve its purpose.
                        The README file serves as a description of the repository to newcomers and will only be displayed by GitHub when in the root folder.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Technically there is another exception to this rule.
                        This documentation has its own static folder containing all files that are not related to the main site.
                        The documentation does use the main static folder to access the elements it has in common with the main site like stylesheets and scripts.
                        This second static folder exists to seperate documentation files from the main site and because the documentation is considered it's own website and therefore redefines the root folder (more information <a href="documentation">here</a>).

    <!-- Static folder subdivision -->
    <section>
        <div class="container">
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-sm-12">
                    <h1><b>Subdivision</b> of the static folder</h1>
                    <p>
                        Just dumping every file that is not a page into the static folder is sadly not good for most people's sanity.
                        Because of this, the static folder is subdivided into 3 more folders: scripts, stylesheets and media.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To this day, all files on this site could always be categorized into one these three folders.
                        If this ever stops being the case, you could create a new category for these new files.
                        Or, if this category-defying menace of a file is too unique to be categorized, drop it straight into <code>static/</code> itself.
                    </p>

                    <h3><code>static/scripts/</code> and <code>static/stylesheets/</code></h3>
                    <p>
                        All JavaScript files should go in the scripts folder and all CSS files should go in the stylesheets folder.
                        This is to distinguish vital code that affects the entire page from more individualized assets that only affect their general viscinity.
                        More on JavaScript and Stylesheets <a href="code">here</a>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At the point of writing, the scripts and Stylesheets in these folders are so generic, general and scarce in numbers that they are not sorted into further subfolders.
                        If more subdivisions ever become nescessary, feel free to make them, but be wary of the final note at the bottom of this page on moving files.
                    </p>

                    <h3><code>static/media/</code></h3>
                    <p>
                        As the name implies, all images, pdf's, sound effects, ... go here.
                        The media folder itself also has some categories to further structure the files inside.
                        The most important ones are <code>static/media/pages/</code> and <code>static/media/people/</code>.
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <h4><code>static/media/pages/</code></h4>
                            <p>
                                This folder is for the media that is specific to a single page.
                                This means that files that are unique to the about page will be in <code>static/media/pages/about</code>.
                                An example is the banner on the homepage.
                                This is a picture of someone wearing a BEST sweater at a lake.
                                It is only used by the homepage, on the homepage and therefore resides in <code>static/media/pages/home/</code>.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It can be tempting when creating a new page to put every new image into that new page's media folder.
                                The problem is that if this file is later deemed cool enough to be used elsewhere (which is very common with images of people/groups f.e.), it is still linked to that one page.
                                So in that case the file must be moved to a different location, which poses the risk of breaking pages that are currently using it (see the note on moving files below).
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                So where does a file go if it is not unique to a single page?
                                For these files there are other folders in <code>static/media/</code>, like the people folder.
                                Just as with the main <code>static/</code> folder, files that are too unique to be categorized can just be dumped into <code>static/media/</code> itself.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h4><code>static/media/people/</code></h4>
                            <p>
                                Every image or document that is related to a person goes into the folder of that person in here.
                                For example: A profile picture for the autumn course of 2025 of Emmanuel Obiringa will go into <code>static/media/people/Emmanuel Obiringa/Emmanuel_pfp_autumn_course_2025.jpg</code>.
                                Know that there will be many images with similar meanings in one person's folder, so be specific when naming them.
                                Just <code>Emmanuel_pfp.jpg</code> is not specific enough, as he might want a different pfp for different events.
                                Renaming files can cause a mess (see the note on moving files below), so try to get the name right first try.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                    </ol>

    <!-- Unused & Broken pages -->
    <section class="section-odd">
        <div class="container">
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-sm-12">
                    <h1><b>Unused</b> pages</h1>
                    <p>
                        A page is considered unused when:
                        The page is not (meant to) be accessed by anyone anymore, won't be missed in any way if removed and, <b>importantly</b>, there are no links anywhere on the website that link to it anymore.
                        If all of these criteria are met, you can remove that page (delete the <code>index.html</code> and the folder that contained it) from the site.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Removing unused pages helps keeping the codebase contained in size and should be done whenever a page becomes unused.
                        It is important to know that removing a page from the code base <b>does not</b> remove it from the commit history.
                        You will always be able to access anything that has ever been part of the website by checking out a commit from that time using Git.
                        So don't worry when removing something: It was archived the moment it was added to the site.
                        This is also why it is important to <b>never</b> add passwords or other sensitive information to the website, because it will be technically be accessible until the site's repository itself is removed from GitHub.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If a page is unused or not can sometimes be a bit of a gray area.
                        Think of the page of an event from a long time ago.
                        Is it still used? No, but does it hurt to still exist? Also no.
                        In cases like this, it might be wise to <b>discuss</b> the removal of that page with the President, or at an LV.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Pages of local courses should remain accessible to the participants by their original link.
                        They should not be relocated (as that would break the link) and are never considered unused.
                        This is why all local course pages go into the <code>localcourses/</code> folder.
                        This prevents them from cluttering the root directory.
                    </p>
                    <h1><b>Broken</b> pages</h1>
                    <p>
                        When making changes to the website, it is good practice to <b>check</b> if those changes unintentionally affected <b>other pages</b> than the one you worked on.
                        This can be especially tricky when tinkering with the template system, as almost all pages rely on it.
                        Still, it can happen that a page breaks because someone forgot to check if their changes broke something or simply because programming is hard and the internet is ever-changing.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A page is considered broken when
                        content doesn't render (correctly),
                        widgets like links, buttons, ... don't work anymore,
                        dynamic content like the events in the calendar is not retrieved correctly
                        or anything else is <b>not as it is supposed to be</b>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If a page is broken, it should either be fixed or removed.
                        For active pages it is clear that they should be fixed, and unused pages should already be removed due to being unused.
                        But for pages where it's not clear if they are unused or not, their level of disrepair can be a deciding factor:
                        If it is <b>not worth</b> the effort to repair a page that is already not really used anymore, don't repair it.

                                Use the <code>static/media/pages/</code> directory as little as possible by categorizing files correctly.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Every file that is related to a person goes into that person's <code>static/media/people/</code> folder.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Remove unused pages.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Always repair or remove broken pages.
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                        If you feel like there is a rule missing, or want to change an existing rule, add them to this page with an explanation about <b>why</b> the rule exists.
                        Before changing existing rules, make sure you don't hinder the original intentions of that rule (like the static folder preventing file repetition).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Also make sure the new rule is applied <b>consistently</b> to the entire codebase and not only to new files.
                        f.e. when you make a rule saying all folder names should start with the letter 'a', make sure to also rename all existing folders accordingly.
                        If only half the codebase uses a rule, then it's not a rule but a mess.

                    <p>
                        The largest disadvantage of sharing a file among many different pages is that when you delete, move, rename,... that file, all of the pages that reference it will not be able to find it anymore.
                        This means you should really think about the name and place of new files when you add them, because moving them later might be a hassle and could break many different pages at once.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You can still do this if you think a restructuring of the files is nescessary, but make sure that, afterwards, you check <b>every single page</b> for missing files/being broken.
