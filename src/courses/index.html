                    <p>The only requirement for applying to a BEST course is that you are a legitimate student at the UGent
                        during that year at one of the following faculties: Engineering and Architecture, Bioscience Engineering
                        or Sciences.</p>

                    <p>Most courses are introductory and require only a little bit of knowledge of the topic of the course.
                        There are some advanced courses as well, but the precise prerequisites for each course will always
                        be mentioned during the application process.</p>

                    <p>In order to go on a course, you have to write a short motivation letter for the organising students.
                        Increase your chances for getting accepted by sending us your motivation letter, so that we can give
                        elaborate feedback. Furthermore, a few tips &amp; tricks and examples are listed below.</p>

                                <p>it is a time of bad weather and relentless deadlines in the country of Belgium. John Smith,
                                    a twenty-years old engineering student specialised in the art of electricity, is dreaming
                                    of a hot and awesome summer vacation. He plans to travel across the continent of Europe
                                    to have one of the best vacations of his life. Perhaps even the BEST vacation...</p>
                                <p>Meanwhile, several miles away in a beautiful city called Nis, dark powers are rising. The
                                    Serbian Empire is threatened by hundreds of applicants trying to break into the city
                                    of Nis and their relentless hunger for knowledge and great parties might lead the entire
                                    city into chaos. The Empire, however, strikes back by asking trikcy questions and demanding
                                    a well-thought and well-written motivation letter of each of these applicants.</p>
                                <p>These demands have a terrifying effect on our hero. Is it not enough for him to tell the
                                    organisers that he just want to have a good time in Serbia and would love to join their
                                    course? Is it not enough for him to say that despite being a rather sociable and pleasant
                                    fellow, he still desires to take his social skills to the next level? That he loves writing,
                                    plays the bass guitar and is a great enjoyer of martial arts? Or that he even likes to
                                    cantus and knows how to make a party fun?</p>
                                <p>Desperate and broken, our hero is trying his best to write a relatively coherent and amusing
                                    motivation letter. He doesn't have much, but as his girlfriend always used to say: "Size
                                    matters not".</p>

                                    I've always loved building stuff and constructing my dream buildings. Even as a kid I
                                    spent hours and days and weeks building things (yes it was LEGO and Knex, but it still
                                    counts!). Sadly I never got around to pursuing architecture (as it turns out you can't
                                    do everything at once in life!) but it's always remained one of my interests, and I seize
                                    every opportunity I can to refresh my passion for it. The fact that your course combines
                                    this with 3D modeling and design just makes it more interesting. What's better than building
                                    LEGO pirate ships? Building LEGO pirate ships in 3D! Also (I'm not going to lie... again)
                                    of course one of the reasons I'm so excited is because you're in BARCELONA :)!! I love
                                    going to Spain and travelling around there, but to my shame, I've only went to Barcelona
                                    for one day yet. I visited some of the real 'big' things to see (Sagrada Familia, some
                                    of the works of Gaudi) , but I saw that there was so much more to do there that I didn?t
                                    have time for, so I vowed to return one day and make up for all of it :) And to explore
                                    the nightlife in Barcelona too ^^</p>
                                <p>Alright dear reader, by now you're probably tired of reading a bagazillion motivation letters
                                    and you want another beer, so I'll be quick and tell you why you'd like to have me on
                                    your autumn course! ^^ I'm fun(ny), social, outgoing, spontaneous, really interested
                                    in the course, a party animal, and I manage to have loads of fun wherever I am and in
                                    whatever situation I'm in! You will never see me bringing the party down, I like to make
                                    parties LEGENDARY ;) Also I don't need that much sleep so I can repeat the pattern every
                                    day and night! Accept me and I promise I will do everything in my power to make your
                                    course that little bit more awesome!</p>
                                <p>Get that next beer and hope to see you soon :) Cheers!</p>

                                <p>Hallo da!</p>
                                <p>AYE! Who am I? Hennie -Henniebal- Vector. How old am I? 19 years young Where do I live? Close
                                    to Ghent. What do I study? Computer Engineering in Ghent, Belgium’s greatest city ever
                                    build, and perhaps even the world, if there wouldn’t be the glorious city of Graz with
                                    its habitants. In my spare time I play basketball and still try to get into the NBA,
                                    try to break the beer pong record in a local pub, listen to rock music, participate in
                                    Rock-Paper-Scissors contests and, while having a nice glass of beer, I eat. A lot.</p>
                                <p>While doing so, drinking some Stella Artois and listening to Mayonaise by The Smashing Pumpkins
                                    the engineer deep inside of me started to think. “Those (Belgian) fries, a few minutes
                                    ago they were just mere potatoes without any taste, and now they’ve got a waaaay-too-delicious
                                    golden crust.” How the hell is that possible? I started to look on the internet, but
                                    couldn’t really find an answer.</p>
                                <p>A few days later some bastard, a friend of mine perhaps, told me about BEST, how AWESOME
                                    their courses were, how many great parties he had, how many amazing people he met and
                                    how great his lectures were, which surprised me, because he was just the same as me;
                                    a party animal whose goal on party’s is to stay as the last person standing. I became
                                    curious and started to look on their site.</p>
                                <p>And I was stunned. You damn mateys organize a mother-freaking SCIENCE IN FOOD course! But
                                    would I like the country? I took a quick look and saw Graz, Austria on the right of “Place”.
                                    Even more uber-wonderful! Austria, land of the wondrous Alp landscapes, Austria, one
                                    of the only lands who could match the Belgian beer brewing and drinking, Austria, with
                                    its people known for their “Gemuetlichkeit” and Graz, the beautiful city with its even
                                    more beautiful Old Town!</p>
                                <p>Then I read the schedule while listening to Bullet in the Head by Rage against the Machine
                                    (\m/) and I felt a shock going through my mind (luckily, not by a bullet). WONDERFUL!
                                    The schedule is way too cool! Loads of partying, City Rally, time enough to socialize
                                    (not only by drinking), time enough to consume and experiment with food. AYE!</p>
                                <p>Especially the latter part attracts me to BEST. Except for beer, one of the best things in
                                    the world is learning to know so many same-minded people from all over Europe, with their
                                    culture and habits.</p>
                                <p>I can’t express to you mateys how much I’d love to go and have this amazing 9 days lasting
                                    unforgettable experience. I’m ready to make it so, and without a doubt, you are ready
                                    to do so as well! Hoping to see you all in real life mateys! :D</p>
                                <p>Auf Wiedersehen,</p>
                                <p>Hennie</p>

                                <p>Ciao Roma!</p>
                                <p>You’ve probably been reading motivation letters all day long, but this is the one you’ve
                                    been waiting for! Or if this is the first letter you got your hands on, let me tell you:
                                    it’s immediately bull’s eye, which will save you countless hours of reading ;-)</p>
                                <p>But first things first, let me introduce myself: my name is Sander, and I’m a 20 year old
                                    student from Belgium, currently enrolled in the 2nd bachelor of Engineering Physics.
                                    Luckily however, I’m one of those students who actually has some other pastimes besides
                                    studying, namely gaming – great for training those reflexes and overall reaction speed!
                                    – and my even bigger passion, music. I play the alto saxophone in a wind band – see,
                                    I’m a real group person – and at home I also play the piano, at least until my brother
                                    or sister complains about the noise. Furthermore listening to music is like a 24/7 thing,
                                    but I’m not too picky about what I listen to. Did I mention yet I love making movie references?
                                    Or that I can windsurf? Or that I also speak French, besides Dutch and English? Only
                                    one way (*) to get to know me even better…</p>
                                <p>So now you know what makes me tick, but why would I possibly want to go on a BEST course
                                    in Rome? It’s not too hard to imagine: visiting the biggest cultural city of Europe,
                                    with so many monuments and historical sites that just one BEST course won’t be enough
                                    to uncover all of its mysteries. Climbing the Colosseum, just like Ezio in Assassin’s
                                    Creed. Making new friends from all over Europe, while enjoying the best company Italy
                                    has to offer, along with its fine wine and food. Of course you can count me in!</p>
                                <p>Not to mention the interesting topic: the world is dark, and full of terrors! So learning
                                    a bit about emergencies and how to handle them may prove someday to be a life saver,
                                    and I will have you to thank for! It wouldn’t be the first time someone took an arrow
                                    to the knee, but if Adele really could set fire to the rain, it requires one hell of
                                    an emergency plan, one I’d be willing – and loving – to help create. *insert dramatic
                                    music* Needless to say this course will give me the knowledge and strength to be the
                                    hero Gotha… errhm…, Rome needs, not the one it deserves! (See what I did there?)</p>
                                <p>Well, that’s about everything I could think of – before it got too boring – so, ti è piaciuto?</p>
                                <p>I hope to see you all in October,</p>
                                <p>Sander</p>

                    <h1 class="text-center">Here are some <b>application tips.</b></h1>

                    <p>In order to go on a BEST course, your application letter will first have to go through the selection
                        procedure. Only 22 students will be selected while there are sometimes hundreds of applicants for
                        a single course!</p>

                    <p>To get the best out of your letter, we have some tips here that should give you a headstart:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Keep in mind you're writing to fellow students. There is no need for formalities at all.</li>
                        <li>A good letter is brief yet informative. It's not good to be too generic when describing yourself
                            but you shouldn't get lost in the details. Highlighting specific parts is key.</li>
                        <li>Be sure to mention something about the country and/or city you're applying for! Also, you can already
                            find some relevant information in the Survival Guide of the course you’re applying for</li>
                        <li>Certainly mention any relevant experience you have of the topic of the course (can also be extra-curricular)
                            but don't start writing down school grades</li>
                        <li>It is highly advised to apply to several courses at once as this greatly increases your chances of
                            going on a BEST course that season. You can just copy the general parts of your motivation letter,
                            after all.</li>
                        <li>Make use of paragraphs and check for spelling and grammar mistakes before your submission. Preferably
                            a day or so after you've written it (then you'll notice them better).</li>
                        <li>Humour is always a plus, as long as it's appropriate and spontaneous.</li>
                        <li>Provide "eye catchers" to catch the reader's attention and pay special attention to the first and
                            the last line of your letter, as they will always be read even if they are just skimming over
                            your letter.</li>
                        <li>Remember that you HAVE to go there, be convincing!</li>

                        <li>Be creative! People have tried rhymes, short stories, limericks... before with great success because
                            nothing stands out as much as a really original letter.</li>

                    <p>BEST courses are organized during the entire year. The period and number of days of a BEST course, are
                        chosen by the organizing local BEST group.<br> The courses are grouped into four seasons:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Spring: March - June</li>
                        <li>Summer: July - August</li>
                        <li>Autumn: September - November</li>
                        <li>Winter: December - February</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Each season has a certain application period, usually one season beforehand. The whole application procedure
                        takes place on our international website.</p>

                    <p>A couple of days before the application deadline, we usually organise a motivation letter workshop, to
                        give you even more hints and feedback in a personal and interactive way.</p>
